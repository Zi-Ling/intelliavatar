# IntelliAvatar  
### The AI Worker OS — from chat to true desktop autonomy.

IntelliAvatar is **not a chatbot**.  
It is an **AI Worker Operating System** designed to perform real work on real desktops —  
clicking, typing, navigating apps, reading screens, organizing files, running workflows,  
and executing tasks end-to-end like a digital employee.

> **Our mission: Give AI the ability to actually *do things*, not just talk.**

This project is under active development and built fully in public.

## 🚀 Vision

Modern AI can answer questions —  
but it still cannot reliably operate a real computer.

IntelliAvatar aims to change that by building a full-stack desktop agent capable of:

- Planning multi-step tasks  
- Operating Windows apps visually (GUI actions)  
- Executing workflows autonomously  
- Observing the environment and re-planning  
- Managing files, browsers, documents, apps  
- Running scheduled / recurring tasks  
- Building memory and improving over time  
- Acting like a true virtual worker, not a chat interface

This is early, but the foundation is being built rapidly.

## 🎨 UI Concepts (Early Explorations)

> These are early-stage design directions to define the future UX of IntelliAvatar.

### 🖥️ Control Panel
*(embed your screenshot here)*  

### 🗂️ Workspace / Task Flow  

More UI concepts will be added as the system evolves.

## 🧠 Core System Pillars (High-Level Overview)

> Code implementation is currently private.  
> Below is the conceptual architecture guiding development.

- **Skills Engine** — file ops, GUI ops, web ops, custom skills  
- **Planner** — converts intent → task graph (linear & DAG)  
- **Runtime / Agent Loop** — execution, retries, re-planning  
- **Perception** — screen reading & GUI understanding (upcoming)  
- **Memory** — short-term task memory → future long-term knowledge  
- **Scheduler** — recurring tasks & automation  
- **Shadow Mode** — real-time autonomous desktop operation (planned)

A modular system designed to scale into a full AI Worker OS.

## 📌 Current Status (Prototype Stage)

- End-to-end skill invocation pipeline working  
- File operations, basic desktop automation  
- Planner v1 implemented  
- Task graph + runtime loop functioning  
- Logging & execution traces  
- UI prototypes completed (Control Panel, Workspace)  
- Shadow Mode & Perception in development  
- Rapid iteration ongoing
