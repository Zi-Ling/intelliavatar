# Learning Module (WIP)

The Learning module enables the avatar to improve over time  
by analyzing previous episodes stored in Memory.

Its long-term goals include:

- Identifying successful patterns in past interactions  
- Refining or generalizing existing skills  
- Proposing new skills extracted from repeated workflows  
- Adjusting planning strategies based on experience  

Early versions may include simple rule extraction or feedback loops.  
Future versions aim to support autonomous self-improvement  
toward a more human-like learning process.
