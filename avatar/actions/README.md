# Actions Module

The Actions module contains the lowest-level, atomic operations  
that represent the avatar’s direct ability to act on the environment.

Common categories include:

- Mouse actions (click, move, scroll)  
- Keyboard actions (type, hotkeys)  
- System commands (run process, manage files)  
- Waiting, polling, or synchronization primitives  

All higher-level Skills are built from Actions.  
The Actions module forms the avatar’s “motor layer”  
and provides a consistent, platform-independent interface for execution.
