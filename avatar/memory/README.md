# Memory Module

The Memory module stores the avatar’s experiences,  
transforming raw interaction traces into meaningful long-term memory.

Key responsibilities:

- Recording episodes of actions, perceptions, and outcomes  
- Organizing memories for efficient retrieval  
- Supporting the Planner with relevant past experiences  
- Enabling future learning mechanisms based on success/failure patterns  

Memory is designed to accumulate over time,  
forming the avatar’s “experience backbone” for future adaptability.
