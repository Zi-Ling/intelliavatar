# Skills Module

The Skills module contains reusable mid-level abilities  
that combine multiple primitive actions into meaningful operations.

Examples of capability categories:

- Navigating interfaces and environments  
- Extracting and processing on-screen or textual information  
- Performing structured workflows through multi-step automation  
- Handling routine operational or diagnostic tasks  

Skills evolve alongside the avatar:

- Early stage: basic automation abilities  
- Mid stage: context-aware multi-step behaviors  
- Long term: self-refined, experience-derived skills  

Skills serve as the avatar’s “toolbox” for acting in complex environments.
